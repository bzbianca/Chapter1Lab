1. What was the most challenging part of translating from Python concepts to Java syntax?
The most challenging part of translating was when I had to figure out how each keyword was typed out in Java syntax versus Python. After finding out how, I was able to make each solution through my previous experience with Python concepts.
2. When did you use AI assistance and what did it help you with?
I mostly used AI to check for errors in the code that I didn't understand how to fix in Java. I also asked it how to do certain things in Java such as rounding up floats.
3. Was there anything in Java that you liked better than in Python?
I liked how it is mostly the same logic as Python and that I was able to convert my knowledge so fast after starting the problems.
